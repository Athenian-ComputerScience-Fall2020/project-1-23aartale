# Pseudocode for this program

# How this code works
## The game
* First you need to list out all the players that the user will
pick for each position
    * I did a print statement line by line so it looks more clear
    when the user follows it
* Next assign a value to each player so the user knows how much
money they are spending per player
    * I made it fairly difficult to go over the amount so the user
    can be more free with their spending options
* The user chooses their players then gets asked if they want to play again
## What is happening in the background
* After the user picks each player I run in the background a
true statement so if the user doesn't pick one of the players
that asks them to reinput
* As well, when the user is picking their player I run a math operation
that takes their money that they have in the bank and subtracts
it by the value of the player they have chosen.
* At the end their is a while True statement which asks them
if they want to play again they can by pressing y and if
they want to stop they can press n.
* I have a try and except at the end so if they print a
number that it will ask them the same question again.
